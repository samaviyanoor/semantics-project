<h2> A Killer Paradox (2024) </h2>

<p> ➢ "Recently released on <i>Netflix,</i> the <b>Choi Woo-shik-</b>starring A Killer Paradox has been <br>
dominating the streaming service’s most-watched list and for good reason. The show combines <br>
supernatural, vigilantism and fantasy elements to make for a unique but enthralling watch. <br>
<b>Choi’s Lee Tang</b> rapidly descends into a dark place after he triggers an urge to kill, his moral <br>
compass taking a battering as he grapples with the fact his victims are all villains who could be <br> 
perceived as “deserving” death. Fascinating and thought-provoking in equal measure." </p>

<h2> Bargain (2023) </h2>

<p> ➢ "Few dramas are quite as intense as <i>Bargain,</i> which starts off shocking and continues <br> 
to escalate things until its very end. At first, it seems like a cut-and-dry story of a schoolgirl <br>
trying to sell her virginity to a slimeball man. But an early plot twist quickly reveals that the motel <br> 
they’re meeting in is actually a human trafficking HQ, and <b>Hyung-soo’s</b> organs are about to be <br>
auctioned off to the highest bidder – that is, until a natural disaster strikes. Filmed using a <br>
continuous take technique, <i>Bargain</i> is claustrophobic and dark but incredibly gripping.</p>

<h2> My Name (2021) </h2>

<p> ➢ <b>"Yoon Ji-woo (Han So-hee) </b> is fuelled by revenge. Her gangster father’s <br>
premature death at the hands of a mystery killer makes her determined to find <br>
the culprit and enact justice, with her going to extreme lengths to achieve her <br>
goal. Han’s ability to play the badass should be in little doubt by now, but <br>
her performance in <i>My Name</i> will more than convince you." </p>

<h2> Revenant (2023) </h2>
<p> ➢ "<b>Kim Tae-ri</b> is spectacular in <i>Revenant</i> as <i>Gu San-yeong</i>, <br>
a young woman who gets unexpectedly wrapped in the terrifying <br>
world of the supernatural following her father’s death. Whether she’s <br>
portraying the fear of <b>San-yeong</b> as she tries to reclaim her life and stop the <br>
mysterious suicides taking over her hometown or conveying the evil of <br>
the spirit that possesses her, the actor delivers a spine-tinglingly great <br>
performance throughout. Just don’t watch <i>Revenant</i> too late at night." </p>

<h2> The Glory (2022-2023) </h2>

<p> ➢ "Both parts of <i>The Glory</i> shook the world when it was released and <br>
had real-life consequences in Korea, putting a spotlight on the violent <br>
bullying that has occurred in schools in the country. It follows <b>Moon Dong-eun <br>
(Song Hye-kyo)</b>, a teacher who was the target of horrific bullying when she was <br>
a kid. Despite now being grown up, <b>Dong-eun</b> hasn’t moved past the abuse <br>
she faced and decides to seek revenge on her old bullies, finally <br>
getting even for what they did to her." </p>
